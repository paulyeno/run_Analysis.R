    "tidy.txt" contains 10299 observations (rows) of 87 variables (columns), combining the train and the test data sets, beginning with the type of activity and then the observations, as datailed in steps 1-4 in the assignment.
    The first column lists the activity.
    the other 86 columns list the means and standard deviations of the observation.
    
    "tidy2.txt" contains 180 observations (rows) of 88 variables (columns), combining the train and the test data sets, beginning with the subject (person participating in the study, labeled by a number from 1 to 30), the then the type of activity (labeled with a pretty text label), followed by the average of all observations of the person doing that particular activity.
    The first column lists the subject (the person participating in the study)
    The second column lists the activity.
    The other 86 columns list the means of the mean and standard deviation of the data set, subsetted by the subject and activity.    
    "run_Analysis.R" functions as follows (see large font lines, which are comments in code):
